# Introduction to Machine Learning Terminology
Machine learning is not a passing fad, it is something that is here to stay and has always been of interest to humanity.

* AI: Artificial Intelligence. It refers to the ability of a machine to perform tasks that should be reserved by human intelligence, fulfilling them at the same level or better.

* ML: Machine Learning. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves a lot of data to be able to provide it in some way to a software and that can solve a specific task without the need for it to be explicitly programmed to perform it.

Within ML we have three main types of learning algorithms:
1. Supervised learning: This type requires labels, the data will have yes or no labels.
2. Unsupervised learning: Our input variables will have a weight and then add those variables and we will have a result. This is nothing more than a linear regression.
3. Reinforcement learning: If I only have the input variables. You can group and search for patterns. Take actions to maximize the reward in a specific situation.

* DL: Deep learning. It is ML with multi-layered neural networks that can learn associations between inputs and outputs. These networks with different nodes and resemble how a neuron in the human body works.
