# Introduction to Machine Learning Terminology
Machine learning is not a passing fad, it is something that is here to stay and has always been of interest to humanity.

* AI: Artificial Intelligence. It refers to the ability of a machine to perform tasks that should be reserved by human intelligence, fulfilling them at the same level or better.

* ML: Machine Learning. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves a lot of data to be able to provide it in some way to a software and that can solve a specific task without the need for it to be explicitly programmed to perform it.

Within ML we have three main types of learning algorithms:
1. Supervised learning: This type requires labels, the data will have yes or no labels.
2. Unsupervised learning: Our input variables will have a weight and then add those variables and we will have a result. This is nothing more than a linear regression.
3. Reinforcement learning: If I only have the input variables. You can group and search for patterns. Take actions to maximize the reward in a specific situation.

* DL: Deep learning. It is ML with multi-layered neural networks that can learn associations between inputs and outputs. These networks with different nodes and resemble how a neuron in the human body works.

# Terminology and linear regression
Linear regression is going to give us just what we want as a resolution of a ML problem. We start from an equation, the Y will be our label or variable that we are predicting, the X that will be our input variable and we will call it feature.

* Model: Once we build our model with the historical data, we are going to predict the future and that the machine can make those decisions with what has already been learned.

* Training: To predict the future, we will have a training stage. In this stage you will learn how the variables are related

* Inference: We use our model to make predictions

To build a model we use the input variables being necessary to normalize one to have a numerical representation and we build an equation.

The difference that may exist between the result and the real value, we must try not to exist so that the prediction is as close as possible to the real value, it will not be 100%, but the difference or loss must be low. To get there we must choose the correct weight.
